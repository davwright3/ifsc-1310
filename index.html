      <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
      <p>I have really enjoyed the learning experience that I have had this semester.  I came in with a small bit of knowledge on how HTML works from spending some time a few years ago in the HTML for Dummies book, but most of that was probably just spent forming bad habits.  I came into this class because it was required as part of my Computer Science degree, but had so much fun learning the process of creating a website from the ground up that I considered changing my major. </p>
      <p>This final project was a culmination of that work, and when I began my rough draft I though I was 100% ready to go.  I could not have been further from the truth.  For one, I wish I could have spent far more time refining my skills throughout the semester.  I think I did a good job of keeping up, but my schedule did not allow me to spend nearly as much time becoming an expert as I would have liked.  Additionally, my idea for my work flow was not even close to where it needed to be.  I initially wanted to get the template setup by itself, but once I started working on my header and footer, I realized that I would have no idea how they looked on the page until I had at least some of the content in there.  I also realized that if I take even a day off from working on the site, my skills atrophy very quickly, and it takes a good 10-15 minutes for me to really be able to get rolling again once I sit down to start back up.  I don't even want to calculate the hours I wasted trying to put together a header that made no sense along with the time spent just trying to remember how to get started with the code in the morning.</p>
      <p>Once I got the Dragon site where I thought the rough draft was ready for feedback, I got my wife and a couple of my friends to take a look at it.  Some of their feedback included backgrounds being too white, spacing being off, and content being confusing and/or lacking.  One thing that was eye opening to me was that even though I told them that the information I was putting together was "canned" (given to me by the instructor), they still complained about it being outdated or confusing.  This reinforced to me just how important it is as a developer to work closely with your client in order to ensure that the product that is being rolled out is giving their customers the message that they want.</p>
      <p>Another part of the feedback that stuck out to me was how different people appreciated (or didn't appreciate) the formatting of the page so differently.  One person specifically mentioned that the justification of the text in my articles was off putting, while another person commented that they liked it.  I don't think it is possible to build the "perfect" site, and I think that as a developer it is important to be able to take constructive (and less constructive) criticism in stride, because someone will always have feedback on the product that you put out.</p>

<h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>

<p>A "solid foundation" is the one thought that comes up in every article I read on Progressive Enhancement (PE). The idea behind PE is simple, but it is something that it seems like it took the web design community a long time to latch onto, and it makes sense.  One of my favorite aspects of web development is the ability to see your work happen in real time, and using PE as opposed to the old style of Graceful Degredation (GD) can definitely slow down that process, but I think that the work that goes into using PE to build your site is totally worth it in the long run. </p>

<p>One of the biggest differences between GD and PE is that GD is very reactionary.  The design is built, the site is put out and then technical support works on patching holes as they arise.  The benefit is that you get a (hopefully working) site running in a reasonably short amount of time. Unfortunately, this can lead to a lot of lost time due to maintenance, and also lead to less traffic as people who check your site out just to find out that it doesn't work are less likely to return after you fix it.  PE, on the other hand, requires careful planning and execution, but the effort that is put in is worth it when you put out a fully functioning web site that works across as many browsers and systems as possible.  The site will always require maintenance, but hopefully by using PE you can mitigate the effects of that a bit.</p>

<p>The core concept of PE is separating your HTML, CSS and JS, and it starts with making good solid HTML content and markup, at least accoring to <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/progressive-enhancement/">the WebFX page on Progressive Enhancement</a>.  By making everything your customer needs available through this foundation (there's that word), you are already on the right track to providing them a solid user experience.  This HTML content should work independently of the scripting on your site, to ensure that machines that are unable to run the more heavy duty pieces of code can still get full functionality.  Once you have the HTML working flawlessly you can start adding more bells (CSS) and whistles (Javescript) to your site that more modern machines can take advantage of.  By building your site this way, it becomes much easier to provide your user with an accessible, portable and well performing web site, which should really be any developer's goal.</p>
