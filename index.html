      <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
      <p>I have really enjoyed the learning experience that I have had this semester.  I came in with a small bit of knowledge on how HTML works from spending some time a few years ago in the HTML for Dummies book, but most of that was probably just spent forming bad habits.  I came into this class because it was required as part of my Computer Science degree, but had so much fun learning the process of creating a website from the ground up that I considered changing my major. </p>
      <p>This final project was a culmination of that work, and when I began my rough draft I though I was 100% ready to go.  I could not have been further from the truth.  For one, I wish I could have spent far more time refining my skills throughout the semester.  I think I did a good job of keeping up, but my schedule did not allow me to spend nearly as much time becoming an expert as I would have liked.  Additionally, my idea for my work flow was not even close to where it needed to be.  I initially wanted to get the template setup by itself, but once I started working on my header and footer, I realized that I would have no idea how they looked on the page until I had at least some of the content in there.  I also realized that if I take even a day off from working on the site, my skills atrophy very quickly, and it takes a good 10-15 minutes for me to really be able to get rolling again once I sit down to start back up.  I don't even want to calculate the hours I wasted trying to put together a header that made no sense along with the time spent just trying to remember how to get started with the code in the morning.</p>
      <p>Once I got the Dragon site where I thought the rough draft was ready for feedback, I got my wife and a couple of my friends to take a look at it.  Some of their feedback included backgrounds being too white, spacing being off, and content being confusing and/or lacking.  One thing that was eye opening to me was that even though I told them that the information I was putting together was "canned" (given to me by the instructor), they still complained about it being outdated or confusing.  This reinforced to me just how important it is as a developer to work closely with your client in order to ensure that the product that is being rolled out is giving their customers the message that they want.</p>
      <p>Another part of the feedback that stuck out to me was how different people appreciated (or didn't appreciate) the formatting of the page so differently.  One person specifically mentioned that the justification of the text in my articles was off putting, while another person commented that they liked it.  I don't think it is possible to build the "perfect" site, and I think that as a developer it is important to be able to take constructive (and less constructive) criticism in stride, because someone will always have feedback on the product that you put out.</p>
