      <h1>Gordo the Space Monkey</h1>

      <h2>Old Reliable</h2>

      <p>
        Gordo was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as part of NASA's 
        space program.  Eight monkeys had flown on NASA missions before him, 
        five of whom went by the name of Albert. <br /> <br />

        Gordo's historic flight took place on December 13, 1958 when he took off from 
        Cape Canaveral for a 15 minute flight into space.  Even though he was 
        weightless for over 8 minutes, the on board instruments indicated that Gordo 
        enjoyed his journey into space.  Scientists monitoring the flight were pleased 
        to note that the only slight effect Gordo suffered from the entry into space 
        was a modest slowing of his pulse.

      <h2>The Mission</h2>

      <p>
        The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the Atlantic Missile 
        Range at Cape Canaveral, travel further than any monkey had ever travelled 
        before - over 1,500 miles - and reach a height of 310 miles (500 km) before returning
         to Earth and landing in the South Atlantic, 1,302 nautical miles south of Cape 
         Canaveral. <br /> <br />

         "We all heard the rumors that they want to send a monkey up first. Well, none of us 
         wants to think that they're gonna send a monkey up to do a man's work... what they're 
         trying to do to us is send a man up to do a monkey's work."

      <h2>The Jupiter AM-13</h2>

      <p>
        The Jupiter IRBM (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was originally developed by 
        the US Army as a long-range successor to its PGM-11 Redstone missile, byt was eventually 
        taken over and deployed by the USAF for political reasons.  It was also the only one of 
        the United States' early strategic ballistic misiles with some mobility.

        Flight Date: December 13, 1958
        Launch Time: 03.53 EST

      <h2>The Journey</h2>

      <p>
        Gordo wore a specially customised space suit custom made for a monkey about one foot tall.  
        The space suit was fitted with instruments, including temperature meters and microphones 
        which recorded his historic suborbital journey, considered on of the outstanding 
        achievements of space research.

        Flight Time: 15 minutes
        Apogee: 310 miles
