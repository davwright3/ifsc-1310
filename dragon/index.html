                <h2>Dragon Vehicle Overview</h2>

                <p>Dragon is a free-flying spacecraft designed to deliver both cargo and people to orbiting
                    destinations. Dragon made history in 2012 when it became the first commercial spacecraft in history
                    to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and safely return cargo to Earth, a feat
                    previously achieved only by governments.</p>
                <p>It is the only spacecraft currently flying that is capable of returning significant amounts of cargo
                    to Earth. Currently Dragon carries cargo to space, but it was designed from the beginning to carry
                    humans. Under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is now developing the refinements that will enable
                    Dragon to fly crew. Dragon's first manned test flight is expected to take place as early as 2018</p>

                </header>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>DELIVERY AND RETURN SERVICES</strong> - Dragon is the first commercial spacecraft to
                        deliver cargo to the International Space Station and currently the only cargo spacecraft flying
                        capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth. Dragon accommodates pressurized
                        cargo in the capsule as well as unpressurized cargo in its trunk.</li>

                    <li><strong>VERSATILE CARGO RACKS</strong> - The racks are a honeycomb carbon-aluminum construction
                        designed for efficient packing in a zero-gravity environment. They accommodate a variety of
                        standard-size NASA cargo bags as well as freezers for carrying materials such as biological
                        samples.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>PARTNERSHIP WITH NASA</strong> - Dragon was designed from the outset to fly humans to
                        space. Under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is making upgrades to Dragon to allow for crew
                        carrying capability.</li>

                    <li><strong>CREW UPGRADES</strong> - Dragon will be the world’s safest and most reliable crew
                        transport vehicle, with seating for seven, life-support systems, controls with manual
                        capability, and a powered launch escape system.</li>

                    <li><strong>FIRST LAUNCH</strong> - Upgrades to Dragon are currently in progress. Dragon’s first
                        manned test flight is expected to take place as early as 2018.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>FACILITATING RESEARCH</strong> - DragonLab is a free-flying, unmanned platform designed
                        for research and testing in a microgravity environment independent of the International Space
                        Station.</li>

                    <li><strong>LONGEVITY</strong> - It can transport payloads, experiments, instruments, and sensors
                        into space and back to Earth on missions ranging from one week to two years.</li>

                    <li><strong>CAPABILITIES</strong> - DragonLab can readily accommodate instrument and sensor testing,
                        space physics and relativity experiments, radiation effects research, and many other
                        microgravity tests.</li>
